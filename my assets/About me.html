    <p>
        Hello, I'm Mr. Nolan A. Notarte, a versatile professional with a robust background in technical roles <br>
        spanning various industries. Armed with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education majoring <br>
        in Electronics Technology and having successfully passed the Licensure Examination for Teachers <br>
        in 2013, I have continuously pursued higher education to expand my knowledge base.<br>
        <br>
        My professional journey began as an Electronics Technician, Biomedical Technician, and Instrumentation <br>
        Technician across multiple companies, providing me with a solid technical foundation and problem-solving <br>
        skills.<br>
        <br>
        Transitioning into the realm of education in 2014 at Lourdes School of Mandaluyong was a significant <br>
        milestone. As a high school educator in Electronics and Computer Technology, I cultivated an environment <br>
        that nurtured curiosity and innovation among students.<br>
        <br>
        Recognized for my dedication, I was appointed Subject Area Coordinator for Technology and Livelihood <br>
        Education in 2019. In this role, I revitalized educational programs, driving technological advancements <br>
        and ensuring academic excellence within the institution.<br>
        <br>
        Stepping further into educational leadership, I assumed the role of Instructional Technology (IT) Coordinator <br>
        in 2021. Here, I spearheaded initiatives to integrate technology into the school's curriculum, fostering a <br>
        dynamic and progressive learning environment.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, I completed a Master's degree in Learning Management at Saint Paul University Manila. <br>
        This advanced education equipped me with comprehensive insights into learning methodologies and management <br>
        strategies, enhancing my ability to innovate and lead in the educational landscape.<br>
        <br>
        Driven by an unwavering passion for growth and exploration, I am currently delving into web development. <br>
        I am enthusiastic about merging my diverse skill set, combining technical expertise, educational leadership, <br>
        and newfound web development skills, to pioneer innovative solutions and enhance educational experiences.<br>
        <br>
        I am excited about the prospect of transitioning into a career in web development while leveraging my varied <br>
        experiences and educational background to make meaningful contributions in this dynamic field.<br>
